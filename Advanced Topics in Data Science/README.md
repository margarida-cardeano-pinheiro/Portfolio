# Advanced Topics in Data Science

## Course Objectives

The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the ability to identify and apply data mining techniques for knowledge extraction from diverse data sources. Focus areas include association rules, sequence mining, recommendation systems, link analysis, information retrieval, and text mining.

## Learning Outcomes and Skills Acquired

By the end of this course, I gained proficiency in:

1. **Association Pattern Mining:**
Learned to apply the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for discovering frequent itemsets and association rules, and gained insights into summarizing and selecting relevant itemsets and rules.

2. **Web Mining:**
Developed skills in recommender systems, link analysis, and information retrieval to understand how data mining supports recommendations and information connections online.

3. **Information Retrieval:**
Mastered pre-processing, retrieval models, and evaluation techniques to enhance data retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

4. **Text Mining:**
Acquired skills in document representation, clustering, classification, and sentiment/emotion analysis, allowing for effective data extraction from unstructured text sources.

5. **Outlier Mining:**
Explored unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised techniques for identifying anomalies, understanding the challenges and techniques in detecting outliers.

This course enhanced my ability to apply **R** and **RStudio** in data mining processes, from implementing algorithms to evaluating and improving models.

For the Advanced Topics in Data Science course, I worked on a comprehensive analysis of the Chicago Crimes dataset from 2017 to 2023. The project had two main objectives:

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis:** I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in crime occurrences, their locations, and times. This included:

   - Data cleaning and visualization for insights on crime trends.
   - Identifying association rules to highlight common crime characteristics and co-occurring crime situations.
   - Performing link analysis through a graph to explore relationships between different crime entities.

2. **Machine Learning Model Development:** Using insights from the EDA, I developed and evaluated four machine learning models to predict crime occurrences and specific characteristics. This involved:

   - Feature engineering to create more than eight meaningful features based on dataset analysis.
   - Implementing four distinct algorithms, assessing them on metrics like accuracy and precision.
   - The project deliverables included a detailed report (following the IEEE format), an electronic presentation, and the R code for analysis. Each step was documented, with motivations for feature selection, algorithm choices, and findings from model evaluations.
