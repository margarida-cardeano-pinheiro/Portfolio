## The Final Project: Chicago Crimes Analysis
### Objective:
The project aimed to analyze and predict crime patterns in Chicago over six years (2017-2023) using a subset of the Chicago Crimes dataset. This was achieved by combining exploratory data analysis (EDA) with machine learning techniques.

### Key Deliverables:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and creating new features (e.g., `time_of_day`, `quarter`, `week_day`).
   - Produced insightful visualizations to identify trends in crime types, locations, and time periods.
   - Implemented association rule mining to uncover co-occurring crime patterns and used link analysis to detect relationships between crime-related entities.

2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Trained and evaluated four machine learning models to predict arrests:
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - AdaBoost
     - Bagging of Trees
   - Balanced the dataset to handle class imbalance, resulting in fairer model evaluation.
   - Evaluated models on training/testing sets and a hidden validation set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Results Achieved:**
   - Identified key patterns and correlations in Chicago crimes, leading to actionable insights about high-risk locations and time periods.
   - Developed predictive models with high performance on unseen data, demonstrating their potential for real-world applications in crime prevention and resource allocation.

4. **Final Report:**
   - Detailed the entire process in a comprehensive report, highlighting the methodology, insights, and results. The report can be consulted for further details on the projectâ€™s implementation and findings.
